<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;She was a
phantom,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">In</span> lone
Glenartney&rsquo;s thickets lies couched the lordly stag,<br />
The dreaming terrier&rsquo;s tail forgets its customary wag;<br
/>
And plodding ploughmen&rsquo;s weary steps insensibly grow
quicker,<br />
As broadening casements light them on towards home, or
home-brewed liquor.</p>
<p class="poetry">It is (in fact) the evening&mdash;that pure and
pleasant time,<br />
When stars break into splendour, and poets into rhyme;<br />
<a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>When in the
glass of Memory the forms of loved ones shine&mdash;<br />
And when, of course, Miss Goodchild&rsquo;s is prominent in
mine.</p>
<p class="poetry">Miss Goodchild!&mdash;Julia
Goodchild!&mdash;how graciously you smiled<br />
Upon my childish passion once, yourself a fair-haired child:<br
/>
When I was (no doubt) profiting by Dr. Crabb&rsquo;s
instruction,<br />
And sent those streaky lollipops home for your fairy suction!</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;She wore&rdquo; her natural
&ldquo;roses, the night when first we met&rdquo;&mdash;<br />
Her golden hair was gleaming &rsquo;neath the coercive net:<br />
&ldquo;Her brow was like the snawdrift,&rdquo; her step was like
Queen Mab&rsquo;s,<br />
<a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>And gone was
instantly the heart of every boy at Crabb&rsquo;s.</p>
<p class="poetry">The parlour-boarder chass&eacute;ed
tow&rsquo;rds her on graceful limb;<br />
The onyx decked his bosom&mdash;but her smiles were not for
him:<br />
With <i>me</i> she danced&mdash;till drowsily her eyes
&ldquo;began to blink,&rdquo;<br />
And <i>I</i> brought raisin wine, and said, &ldquo;Drink, pretty
creature, drink!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">And evermore, when winter comes in his garb of
snows,<br />
And the returning schoolboy is told how fast he grows;<br />
Shall I&mdash;with that soft hand in mine&mdash;enact ideal
Lancers,<br />
And dream I hear demure remarks, and make impassioned
answers:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>I know that never, never may her love for me
return&mdash;<br />
At night I muse upon the fact with undisguised concern&mdash;<br
/>
But ever shall I bless that day: (I don&rsquo;t bless, as a
rule,<br />
The days I spent at &ldquo;Dr. Crabb&rsquo;s Preparatory
School.&rdquo;)</p>
<p class="poetry">And yet&mdash;we two <i>may</i> meet
again&mdash;(Be still, my throbbing heart!)&mdash;<br />
Now rolling years have weaned us from jam and raspberry
tart:&mdash;<br />
One night I saw a vision&mdash;&rsquo;Twas when musk-roses
bloom<br />
I stood&mdash;<i>we</i> stood&mdash;upon a rug, in a sumptuous
dining-room:</p>
<p class="poetry">One hand clasped hers&mdash;one easily reposed
upon my hip&mdash;<br />
<a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>And
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Bless ye</span>!&rdquo; burst abruptly
from Mr. Goodchild&rsquo;s lip:<br />
I raised my brimming eye, and saw in hers an answering
gleam&mdash;<br />
My heart beat wildly&mdash;and I woke, and lo! it was a
dream.</p>
<h2><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>GEMINI
AND VIRGO.</h2>
<p class="poetry">Some vast amount of years ago,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ere all my youth had vanished from me,<br />
A boy it was my lot to know,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whom his familiar friends called Tommy.</p>
<p class="poetry">I love to gaze upon a child;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A young bud bursting into blossom;<br />
Artless, as Eve yet unbeguiled,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And agile as a young opossum:</p>
<p class="poetry">And such was he.&nbsp; A calm-browed lad,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet mad, at moments, as a hatter:<br />
Why hatters as a race are mad<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I never knew, nor does it matter.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>He was what nurses call a &lsquo;limb;&rsquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; One of those small misguided creatures,<br />
Who, though their intellects are dim,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Are one too many for their teachers:</p>
<p class="poetry">And, if you asked of him to say<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What twice 10 was, or 3 times 7,<br />
He&rsquo;d glance (in quite a placid way)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From heaven to earth, from earth to heaven:</p>
<p class="poetry">And smile, and look politely round,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To catch a casual suggestion;<br />
But make no effort to propound<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Any solution of the question.</p>
<p class="poetry">And so not much esteemed was he<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the authorities: and therefore<br />
He fraternized by chance with me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Needing a somebody to care for:</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>And three fair summers did we twain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Live (as they say) and love together;<br />
And bore by turns the wholesome cane<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till our young skins became as leather:</p>
<p class="poetry">And carved our names on every desk,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And tore our clothes, and inked our collars;<br />
And looked unique and picturesque,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But not, it may be, model scholars.</p>
<p class="poetry">We did much as we chose to do;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We&rsquo;d never heard of Mrs. Grundy;<br />
All the theology we knew<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was that we mightn&rsquo;t play on Sunday;</p>
<p class="poetry">And all the general truths, that cakes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Were to be bought at four a-penny,<br />
And that excruciating aches<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Resulted if we ate too many:</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>And seeing ignorance is bliss,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And wisdom consequently folly,<br />
The obvious result is this&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That our two lives were very jolly.</p>
<p class="poetry">At last the separation came.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Real love, at that time, was the fashion;<br />
And by a horrid chance, the same<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Young thing was, to us both, a passion.</p>
<p class="poetry">Old <span class="smcap">Poser</span> snorted
like a horse:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His feet were large, his hands were pimply,<br />
His manner, when excited, coarse:&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But Miss P. was an angel simply.</p>
<p class="poetry">She was a blushing gushing thing;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All&mdash;more than all&mdash;my fancy painted;<br
/>
Once&mdash;when she helped me to a wing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of goose&mdash;I thought I should have fainted.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>The people said that she was blue:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But I was green, and loved her dearly.<br />
She was approaching thirty-two;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And I was then eleven, nearly.</p>
<p class="poetry">I did not love as others do;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; (None ever did that I&rsquo;ve heard tell of;)<br />
My passion was a byword through<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The town she was, of course, the belle of.</p>
<p class="poetry">Oh sweet&mdash;as to the toilworn man<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The far-off sound of rippling river;<br />
As to cadets in Hindostan<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The fleeting remnant of their liver&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">To me was <span class="smcap">Anna</span>; dear
as gold<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That fills the miser&rsquo;s sunless coffers;<br />
As to the spinster, growing old,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The thought&mdash;the dream&mdash;that she had
offers.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>I&rsquo;d sent her little gifts of fruit;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;d written lines to her as Venus;<br />
I&rsquo;d sworn unflinchingly to shoot<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The man who dared to come between us:</p>
<p class="poetry">And it was you, my Thomas, you,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The friend in whom my soul confided,<br />
Who dared to gaze on her&mdash;to do,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I may say, much the same as I did.</p>
<p class="poetry">One night I <i>saw</i> him squeeze her hand;<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; There was no doubt about the matter;<br />
I said he must resign, or stand<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My vengeance&mdash;and he chose the latter.</p>
<p class="poetry">We met, we &lsquo;planted&rsquo; blows on
blows:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We fought as long as we were able:<br />
My rival had a bottle-nose,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And both my speaking eyes were sable.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>When the school-bell cut short our strife,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Miss P. gave both of us a plaster;<br />
And in a week became the wife<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Horace Nibbs, the writing-master.</p>
<p style="text-align: center" class="poetry">* * *</p>
<p class="poetry">I loved her then&mdash;I&rsquo;d love her
still,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Only one must not love Another&rsquo;s:<br />

And staid young goddesses who flirt with shepherds:)</p>
<p class="poetry">In those old days, the Nymph called
Etiquette<br />

Nor smote a billiard-ball, nor winged a pheasant,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor &lsquo;did&rsquo; their hair by means of
long-tailed combs,<br />
Nor migrated to Brighton once a-year,<br />
Nor&mdash;most astonishing of all&mdash;drank Beer.</p>

Malt<br />

(Wine, water, tempered p&rsquo;raps with Attic salt)&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And not at once invent that mild, luxurious,<br />
And artful beverage, Beer.&nbsp; How the digestion<br />
Got on without it, is a startling question.</p>
<p class="poetry">Had they digestions? and an actual body<br />

Then I pass&rsquo;d into the citizen&rsquo;s garden, and marked a
tree clipt into shape,<br />
(The giant&rsquo;s locks had been shorn by the Dalilahshears of
Decorum;)<br />
And I said, &ldquo;Surely nature is goodly; but how much goodlier
is Art!&rdquo;<br />
I heard the wild notes of the lark floating far over the blue
sky,<br />
And my foolish heart went after him, and lo! I blessed him as he
rose;<br />
Foolish! for far better is the trained boudoir bulfinch,<br />
Which pipeth the semblance of a tune, and mechanically draweth up
water:<br />
And the reinless steed of the desert, though his neck be clothed
with thunder,<br />
<a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>Must
yield to him that danceth and &lsquo;moveth in the circles&rsquo;
at Astley&rsquo;s.<br />
For verily, O my daughter, the world is a masquerade,<br />
And God made thee one thing, that thou mightest make thyself
another:<br />
A maiden&rsquo;s heart is as champagne, ever aspiring and
struggling upwards,<br />
And it needeth that its motions be checked by the silvered cork
of Propriety:<br />
He that can afford the price, his be the precious treasure,<br />
Let him drink deeply of its sweetness, nor grumble if it tasteth
of the cork.</p>
<h3>Of Friendship.</h3>
<p class="poetry">Choose judiciously thy friends; for to discard
them is undesirable,<br />
<a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>Yet it
is better to drop thy friends, O my daughter, than to drop thy
&lsquo;H&rsquo;s&rsquo;.<br />
Dost thou know a wise woman? yea, wiser than the children of
light?<br />
Hath she a position? and a title? and are her parties in the
Morning Post?<br />
If thou dost, cleave unto her, and give up unto her thy body and
mind;<br />
Think with her ideas, and distribute thy smiles at her
bidding:<br />
So shalt thou become like unto her; and thy manners shall be
&ldquo;formed,&rdquo;<br />
And thy name shall be a Sesame, at which the doors of the great
shall fly open:<br />
Thou shalt know every Peer, his arms, and the date of his
creation,<br />
His pedigree and their intermarriages, and cousins to the sixth
remove:<br />
<a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>Thou
shalt kiss the hand of Royalty, and lo! in next morning&rsquo;s
papers,<br />
Side by side with rumours of wars, and stories of shipwrecks and
sieges,<br />
Shall appear thy name, and the minuti&aelig; of thy head-dress
and petticoat,<br />
For an enraptured public to muse upon over their matutinal
muffin.</p>
<h3>Of Reading.</h3>
<p class="poetry">Read not Milton, for he is dry; nor
Shakespeare, for he wrote of common life;<br />
Nor Scott, for his romances, though fascinating, are yet
intelligible:<br />
Nor Thackeray, for he is a Hogarth, a photographer who flattereth
not:<br />
Nor Kingsley, for he shall teach thee that thou shouldest not
dream, but do.<br />
<a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>Read
incessantly thy Burke; that Burke who, nobler than he of old,<br
/>
Treateth of the Peer and Peeress, the truly Sublime and
Beautiful:<br />
Likewise study the &ldquo;creations&rdquo; of &ldquo;the Prince
of modern Romance;&rdquo;<br />
Sigh over Leonard the Martyr, and smile on Pelham the puppy:<br
/>
Learn how &ldquo;love is the dram-drinking of
existence;&rdquo;<br />
And how we &ldquo;invoke, in the Gadara of our still closets,<br
/>
The beautiful ghost of the Ideal, with the simple wand of the
pen.&rdquo;<br />
Listen how Maltravers and the orphan &ldquo;forgot all but
love,&rdquo;<br />
And how Devereux&rsquo;s family chaplain &ldquo;made and unmade
kings:&rdquo;<br />
How Eugene Aram, though a thief, a liar, and a murderer,<br />
<a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>Yet,
being intellectual, was amongst the noblest of mankind.<br />
So shalt thou live in a world peopled with heroes and
master-spirits;<br />
And if thou canst not realise the Ideal, thou shalt at least
idealise the Real.</p>

<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Yet</span> once more, O ye
laurels! and once more<br />
Ye myrtles brown, with ivy never sere,<br />
I come to pluck your berries harsh and crude,<br />
And with forced fingers rude<br />
Shatter your leaves before the mellowing year.<br />
Bitter constraint, and sad occasion dear,<br />
Compels me to disturb your season due;<br />
For Lycidas is dead, dead ere his prime,<br />
Young Lycidas, and hath not left his peer:<br />
Who would not sing for Lycidas?&nbsp; He knew<br />
Himself to sing, and build the lofty rhyme.<br />
He must not float upon his watery bier<br />
Unwept, and welter to the parching wind,<br />
Without the meed of some melodious tear.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
108</span>Begin then, sisters, of the sacred well,<br />
That from beneath the seat of Jove doth spring;<br />
Begin, and somewhat loudly sweep the string.<br />
Hence with denial vain, and coy excuse,<br />
So may some gentle muse<br />
With lucky words favour my destined urn,<br />
And, as he passes, turn<br />
And bid fair peace be to my sable shroud:<br />
For we were nursed upon the self-same hill,<br />
Fed the same flock by fountain, shade, and rill.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Together both, ere the high lawns appeared<br />
Under the opening eyelids of the morn,<br />
We drove afield, and both together heard<br />
What time the gray fly winds her sultry horn,<br />
Battening our flocks with the fresh dews of night,<br />
Oft till the star that rose, at evening, bright,<br />
Toward Heaven&rsquo;s descent had sloped his westering wheel.<br
/>
<a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
110</span>Meanwhile the rural ditties were not mute,<br />
Tempered to the oaten flute;<br />
Rough satyrs danced, and fauns with cloven heel<br />
From the glad sound would not be absent long,<br />
And old Dam&aelig;tas loved to hear our song.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But oh, the heavy change, now thou art gone,<br />
Now thou art gone, and never must return!<br />
Thee, shepherd, thee the woods, and desert caves<br />
With wild thyme and the gadding vine o&rsquo;ergrown,<br />
And all their echoes mourn.<br />
The willows, and the hazel copses green,<br />
Shall now no more be seen,<br />
Fanning their joyous leaves to thy soft lays.<br />
As killing as the canker to the rose,<br />
Or taint-worm to the weanling herds that graze,<br />
Or frost to flowers, that their gay wardrobe wear,<br />
When first the white-thorn blows;<br />
Such, Lycidas, thy loss to shepherd&rsquo;s ear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where were ye, nymphs, when the remorseless deep<br
/>
<a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>Closed
o&rsquo;er the head of your loved Lycidas?<br />
For neither were ye playing on the steep,<br />
Where your old bards, the famous Druids, lie;<br />
Nor on the shaggy top of Mona high,<br />
Nor yet where Deva spreads her wizard stream:<br />
Ay me!&nbsp; I fondly dream!<br />
Had ye been there, for what could that have done?<br />
What could the muse herself that Orpheus bore,<br />
The muse herself for her enchanting son,<br />
Whom universal nature did lament,<br />
When by the rout that made the hideous roar,<br />
His gory visage down the stream was sent,<br />
Down the swift Hebrus to the Lesbian shore?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Alas! what boots it with incessant care<br />
To tend the homely slighted shepherd&rsquo;s trade,<br />
And strictly meditate the thankless muse?<br />
Were it not better done as others use,<br />
To sport with Amaryllis in the shade,<br />
Or with the tangles of Ne&aelig;ra&rsquo;s hair?<br />
<a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>Fame is
the spur that the clear spirit doth raise<br />
(That last infirmity of noble mind)<br />
To scorn delights, and live laborious days,<br />
But the fair guerdon when we hope to find,<br />
And think to burst out into sudden blaze,<br />
Comes the blind fury with the abhorred shears,<br />
And slits the thin-spun life.&nbsp; &ldquo;But not the
praise,&rdquo;<br />
Phoebus replied, and touched my trembling ears;<br />
&ldquo;Fame is no plant that grows on mortal soil,<br />
Nor in the glistering foil<br />
Set off to the world, nor in broad rumour lies,<br />
But lives and spreads aloft by those pure eyes,<br />
And perfect witness of all-judging Jove;<br />
As he pronounces lastly on each deed,<br />
Of so much fame in Heaven expect thy meed.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O fountain Arethuse, and thou honoured flood,<br />
Smooth-sliding Mincius, crowned with vocal reeds,<br />
That strain I heard was of a higher mood:<br />
<a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>But now
my oat proceeds,<br />
And listens to the herald of the sea<br />
That came in Neptune&rsquo;s plea;<br />
He asked the waves, and asked the felon winds,<br />
What hard mishap had doomed this gentle swain?<br />
And questioned every gust of rugged wings,<br />
That blows from off each beaked promontory:<br />
They knew not of his story,<br />
And sage Hippotades their answer brings,<br />
That not a blast was from his dungeon strayed,<br />
The air was calm, and on the level brine<br />
Sleek Panope with all her sisters played.<br />
It was that fatal and perfidious bark<br />
Built in the eclipse, and rigged with curses dark,<br />
That sunk so low that sacred head of thine.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Next Camus, reverend sire, went footing slow,<br />
His mantle hairy, and his bonnet sedge,<br />
Inwrought with figures dim, and on the edge,<br />
Like to that sanguine flower inscribed with woe.<br />
&ldquo;Ah! who hath reft,&rdquo; quoth he, &ldquo;my dearest
pledge?&rdquo;<br />
<a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>Last
came, and last did go,<br />
The pilot of the Galilean lake,<br />
Two massy keys he bore, of metals twain<br />
(The golden opes, the iron shuts amain).<br />
He shook his mitred locks, and stern bespake:<br />
&ldquo;How well could I have spared for thee, young swain,<br />
Enow of such as for their bellies&rsquo; sake<br />
Creep, and intrude, and climb into the fold!<br />
Of other care they little reckoning make,<br />
Than how to scramble at the shearer&rsquo;s feast,<br />
And shove away the worthy bidden guest;<br />
Blind mouths! that scarce themselves know how to hold<br />
A sheep-hook, or have learned aught else the least<br />
That to the faithful herdsman&rsquo;s art belongs!<br />
What reeks it them?&nbsp; What need they?&nbsp; They are sped;<br
/>
And when they list, their lean and flashy songs<br />
Grate on their scrannel pipes of wretched straw;<br />
The hungry sheep look up, and are not fed,<br />
But swollen with wind, and the rank mist they draw,<br />
Rot inwardly, and foul contagion spread:<br />
Besides what the grim wolf with privy paw<br />
Daily devours apace, and nothing said.<br />
<a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>But that
two-handed engine at the door<br />
Stands ready to smite once, and smite no more.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Return, Alpheus, the dread voice is past,<br />
That shrunk thy streams; return, Sicilian muse,<br />
And call the vales, and bid them hither cast<br />
Their bells and flowerets of a thousand hues.<br />
Ye valleys low, where the mild whispers use<br />
Of shades, and wanton winds, and gushing brooks,<br />
On whose fresh lap the swart star sparely looks,<br />
Throw hither all your quaint enamelled eyes,<br />
That on the green turf suck the honeyed showers,<br />
And purple all the ground with vernal flowers.<br />
Bring the rathe primrose that forsaken dies,<br />
The tufted crow-toe, and pale jessamine,<br />
The white pink, and the pansy freaked with jet,<br />
The glowing violet,<br />
The musk-rose, and the well-attired woodbine,<br />
With cowslips wan that hang the pensive head,<br />
And every flower that sad embroidery wears:<br />
Bid amaranthus all his beauty shed,<br />
And daffodillies fill their cups with tears,<br />
<a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>To strow
the laureate hearse where Lycid lies.<br />
For so to interpose a little ease,<br />
Let our frail thoughts dally with false surmise.<br />
Ay me! whilst thee the shores and sounding seas<br />
Wash far away, where ere thy bones are hurled,<br />
Whether beyond the stormy Hebrides,<br />
Where thou, perhaps, under the whelming tide<br />
Visit&rsquo;st the bottom of the monstrous world;<br />
Or whether thou, to our moist vows denied,<br />
Sleep&rsquo;st by the fable of Bellerus old,<br />
Where the great vision of the guarded mount<br />
Looks toward Namancos and Bayona&rsquo;s hold;<br />
Look homeward, angel now, and melt with ruth:<br />
And, O ye dolphins, waft the hapless youth.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Weep no more, woeful shepherds, weep no more,<br />
For Lycidas your sorrow is not dead,<br />
Sunk though he be beneath the watery floor;<br />
So sinks the day-star in the ocean-bed,<br />
And yet anon repairs his drooping head,<br />
<a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>And
tricks his beams, and with new-spangled ore<br />
Flames in the forehead of the morning sky:<br />
So Lycidas sunk low, but mounted high,<br />
Through the dear might of him that walked the waves,<br />
Where other groves and other streams along,<br />
With nectar pure his oozy locks he laves,<br />
And hears the unexpressive nuptial song,<br />
In the blest kingdoms meek of joy and love.<br />
There entertain him all the saints above,<br />
In solemn troops, and sweet societies,<br />
That sing, and singing in their glory move,<br />
And wipe the tears for ever from his eyes.<br />
Now, Lycidas, the shepherds weep no more;<br />
Henceforth thou art the genius of the shore,<br />
In thy large recompense, and shalt be good<br />
To all that wander in that perilous flood.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus sang the uncouth swain to the oaks and
rills,<br />
While the still morn went out with sandals gray,<br />
<a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>He
touched the tender stops of various quills,<br />
With eager thought warbling his Doric lay:<br />
And now the sun had stretched out all the hills,<br />
And now was dropped into the western bay;<br />
At last he rose, and twitched his mantle blue,<br />
Tomorrow to fresh woods, and pastures new.</p>

Standing ashore to descry one afar-off mightily struggling:<br />
Not that a neighbour&rsquo;s sorrow to you yields blissful
enjoyment;<br />
But that the sight hath a sweetness, of ills ourselves are exempt
from.<br />
Sweet &rsquo;tis too to behold, on a broad plain mustering,
war-hosts<br />
Arm them for some great battle, one&rsquo;s self unscathed by the
danger:&mdash;<br />
Yet still happier this:&mdash;To possess, impregnably guarded,<br
/>
<a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>Those
calm heights of the sages, which have for an origin Wisdom;<br />
Thence to survey our fellows, observe them this way and that
way<br />
Wander amidst Life&rsquo;s paths, poor stragglers seeking a
highway:<br />
Watch mind battle with mind, and escutcheon rival escutcheon;<br
/>
Gaze on that untold strife, which is waged &rsquo;neath the sun
and the starlight,<br />
Up as they toil to the surface whereon rest Riches and Empire.<br
/>
O race born unto trouble!&nbsp; O minds all lacking of
eyesight!<br />
&rsquo;Neath what a vital darkness, amidst how terrible
dangers,<br />
Move ye thro&rsquo; this thing, Life, this fragment!&nbsp; Fools,
that ye hear not<br />
Nature clamour aloud for the one thing only; that, all pain<br />
<a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 182</span>Parted
and past from the Body, the Mind too bask in a blissful<br />
Dream, all fear of the future and all anxiety over!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So, as regards Man&rsquo;s Body, a few things only
are needful,<br />
(Few, tho&rsquo; we sum up all,) to remove all misery from
him;<br />
Aye, and to strew in his path such a lib&rsquo;ral carpet of
pleasures,<br />
That scarce Nature herself would at times ask happiness
ampler.<br />
Statues of youth and of beauty may not gleam golden around
him,<br />
(Each in his right hand bearing a great lamp lustrously
burning,<br />
Whence to the midnight revel a light may be furnished always);<br
/>
Silver may not shine softly, nor gold blaze bright, in his
mansion,<br />
<a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>Nor to
the noise of the tabret his halls gold-cornic&egrave;d
echo:&mdash;<br />
Yet still he, with his fellow, reposed on the velvety
greensward,<br />
Near to a rippling stream, by a tall tree canopied over,<br />
Shall, though they lack great riches, enjoy all bodily
pleasure.<br />
Chiefliest then, when above them a fair sky smiles, and the young
year<br />
Flings with a bounteous hand over each green meadow the
wild-flowers:&mdash;<br />
Not more quickly depart from his bosom fiery fevers,<br />
Who beneath crimson hangings and pictures cunningly broidered<br
/>
Tosses about, than from him who must lie in beggarly raiment.<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, since to the Body avail not Riches,
avails not<br />
<a name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
184</span>Heraldry&rsquo;s utmost boast, nor the pomp and the
pride of an Empire;<br />
Next shall you own, that the Mind needs likewise nothing of these
things.<br />
Unless&mdash;when, peradventure, your armies over the
champaign<br />
Spread with a stir and a ferment, and bid War&rsquo;s image
awaken,<br />
Or when with stir and with ferment a fleet sails forth upon
Ocean&mdash;<br />
Cowed before these brave sights, pale Superstition abandon<br />
Straightway your mind as you gaze, Death seem no longer
alarming,<br />
Trouble vacate your bosom, and Peace hold holiday in you.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But, if (again) all this be a vain impossible

them,<br />
<a name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>Heed not
the jav&rsquo;lin&rsquo;s fury, regard not clashing of
broadswords;<br />
But all-boldly amongst crowned heads and the rulers of empires<br
/>
Stalk, not shrinking abashed from the dazzling glare of the red
gold,<br />
Not from the pomp of the monarch, who walks forth
purple-apparelled:<br />
These things shew that at times we are bankrupt, surely, of
Reason;<br />
When too all Man&rsquo;s life through a great Dark laboureth
onward.<br />
For, as a young boy trembles, and in that mystery, Darkness,<br
/>
Sees all terrible things: so do we too, ev&rsquo;n in the
daylight,<br />
Ofttimes shudder at that, which is not more really alarming<br />
Than boys&rsquo; fears, when they waken, and say some danger is
o&rsquo;er them.<br />

us,<br />
Fly not the bright sunbeam, nor the ivory shafts of the

Nature, rightly revealed, and the Reason only, dispel them.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, how moving about do the prime material atoms<br
/>
Shape forth this thing and that thing; and, once shaped, how they
resolve them;<br />
What power says unto each, This must be; how an inherent<br />
Elasticity drives them about Space vagrantly onward;&mdash;<br />
I shall unfold: thou simply give all thyself to my teaching.<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Matter mingled and massed into indissoluble union<br

Does not exist.&nbsp; For we see how wastes each separate
substance;<br />
So flow piecemeal away, with the length&rsquo;ning centuries, all
things,<br />
<a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span>Till
from our eye by degrees that old self passes, and is not.<br />
Still Universal Nature abides unchanged as aforetime.<br />
Whereof this is the cause.&nbsp; When the atoms part from a
substance,<br />
That suffers loss; but another is elsewhere gaining an
increase:<br />
So that, as one thing wanes, still a second bursts into
blossom,<br />
Soon, in its turn, to be left.&nbsp; Thus draws this Universe
always<br />
Gain out of loss; thus live we mortals one on another.<br />
Bourgeons one generation, and one fades.&nbsp; Let but a few
years<br />
Pass, and a race has arisen which was not: as in a racecourse,<br
/>
One hands on to another the burning torch of Existence.</p>
<h3><a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>FROM
HOMER.<br />
<i>Il</i>. I.</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Sing</span>, O daughter of
heaven, of Peleus&rsquo; son, of Achilles,<br />
Him whose terrible wrath brought thousand woes on Achaia.<br />
Many a stalwart soul did it hurl untimely to Hades,<br />
Souls of the heroes of old: and their bones lay strown on the
sea-sands,<br />
Prey to the vulture and dog.&nbsp; Yet was Zeus fulfilling a
purpose;<br />
Since that far-off day, when in hot strife parted asunder<br />
Atreus&rsquo; sceptred son, and the chos&rsquo;n of heaven,
Achilles.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Say then, which of the Gods bid arise up battle
between them?<br />
<a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
189</span>Zeus&rsquo;s and Leto&rsquo;s son.&nbsp; With the king
was kindled his anger:<br />
Then went sickness abroad, and the people died of the
sickness:<br />
For that of Atreus&rsquo; son had his priest been lightly
entreated,<br />
Chryses, Apollo&rsquo;s priest.&nbsp; For he came to the ships of
Achaia,<br />
Bearing a daughter&rsquo;s ransom, a sum not easy to number:<br
/>
And in his hand was the emblem of Him, far-darting Apollo,<br />
High on a sceptre of gold: and he made his prayer to the
Grecians;<br />
Chiefly to Atreus&rsquo; sons, twin chieftains, ordering
armies<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Chiefs sprung of Atreus&rsquo; loins; and ye,
brazen-greav&egrave;d Achaians!<br />
So may the Gods this day, the Olympus-palac&egrave;d, grant
you<br />
<a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
190</span>Priam&rsquo;s city to raze, and return unscathed to
your homesteads:<br />
Only my own dear daughter I ask; take ransom and yield her,<br />
Rev&rsquo;rencing His great name, son of Zeus, far-darting
Apollo.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Then from the host of Achaians arose tumultuous
answer:<br />
&ldquo;Due to the priest is his honour; accept rich ransom and
yield her.&rdquo;<br />
But there was war in the spirit of Atreus&rsquo; son,
Agamemnon;<br />
Disdainful he dismissed him, a right stern fiat
appending:&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Woe be to thee, old man, if I find thee
lingering longer,<br />
Yea or returning again, by the hollow ships of Achaians!<br />
Scarce much then will avail thee the great god&rsquo;s sceptre
and emblem.<br />
<a name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>Her will
I never release.&nbsp; Old age must first come upon her,<br />
In my own home, yea in Argos, afar from the land of her
fathers,<br />
Following the loom and attending upon my bed.&nbsp; But avaunt
thee!<br />
Go, and provoke not me, that thy way may be haply
securer.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; These were the words of the king, and the old man
feared and obeyed him:<br />
Voiceless he went by the shore of the great dull-echoing
ocean,<br />
Thither he got him apart, that ancient man; and a long prayer<br
/>
Prayed to Apollo his Lord, son of golden-ringleted Leto.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord of the silver bow, whose arm girds
Chryse and Cilla,&mdash;<br />
Cilla, loved of the Gods,&mdash;and in might sways Tenedos,
hearken!<br />
<a name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 192</span>Oh! if,
in days gone by, I have built from floor unto cornice,<br />
Smintheus, a fair shrine for thee; or burned in the flames of the
altar<br />
Fat flesh of bulls and of goats; then do this thing that I ask
thee:<br />
Hurl on the Greeks thy shafts, that thy servant&rsquo;s tears be
aveng&egrave;d!&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So did he pray, and his prayer reached the ears of
Phoebus Apollo.<br />
Dark was the soul of the god as he moved from the heights of
Olympus,<br />
Shouldering a bow, and a quiver on this side fast and on that
side.<br />
Onward in anger he moved.&nbsp; And the arrows, stirred by the
motion,<br />
Rattled and rang on his shoulder: he came, as cometh the
midnight.<br />
<a name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 193</span>Hard by
the ships he stayed him, and loosed one shaft from the
bow-string;<br />
Harshly the stretched string twanged of the bow all
silvery-shining;<br />
First fell his wrath on the mules, and the swift-footed hound of
the herdsman;<br />
Afterward smote he the host.&nbsp; With a rankling arrow he smote
them<br />
Aye; and the morn and the even were red with the glare of the
corpse-fires.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nine days over the host sped the shafts of the god:
and the tenth day<br />
Dawned; and Achilles said, &ldquo;Be a council called of the
people.&rdquo;<br />
(Such thought came to his mind from the goddess, Hera the
white-armed,<br />
Hera who loved those Greeks, and who saw them dying around
her.)<br />
<a name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 194</span>So when
all were collected and ranged in a solemn assembly,<br />
Straightway rose up amidst them and spake swift-footed
Achilles:&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Atreus&rsquo; son! it were better, I think
this day, that we wandered<br />
Back, re-seeking our homes, (if a warfare <i>may</i> be
avoided);<br />
Now when the sword and the plague, these two things, fight with
Achaians.<br />
Come, let us seek out now some priest, some seer amongst us,<br
/>
Yea or a dreamer of dreams&mdash;for a dream too cometh of
God&rsquo;s hand&mdash;<br />
Whence we may learn what hath angered in this wise Phoebus
Apollo.<br />
Whether mayhap he reprove us of prayer or of oxen unoffered;<br
/>
<a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 195</span>Whether,
accepting the incense of lambs and of blemishless he-goats,<br />
Yet it be his high will to remove this misery from us.&rdquo;<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Down sat the prince: he had spoken.&nbsp; And uprose
to them in answer<br />
Kalchas Thestor&rsquo;s son, high chief of the host of the
augurs.<br />
Well he knew what is present, what will be, and what was
aforetime;<br />
He into Ilion&rsquo;s harbour had led those ships of Achaia,<br
/>
All by the Power of the Art, which he gained from Phoebus
Apollo.<br />
Thus then, kindliest-hearted, arising spake he before them:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Peleus&rsquo; son!&nbsp; Thou demandest, a
man heavenfavor&rsquo;d, an answer<br />
<a name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 196</span>Touching
the Great King&rsquo;s wrath, the afar-off-aiming Apollo:<br />
Therefore I lift up my voice.&nbsp; Swear thou to me, duly
digesting<br />
All,&mdash;that with right good will, by word and by deed, thou
wilt aid me.<br />
Surely the ire will awaken of one who mightily ruleth<br />
Over the Argives all: and upon him wait the Achaians.<br />
Aye is the battle the king&rsquo;s, when a poor man kindleth his
anger:<br />
For, if but this one day he devour his indignation,<br />
Still on the morrow abideth a rage, that its end be
accomplished,<br />
Deep in the soul of the king.&nbsp; So bethink thee, wilt thou
deliver.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Then unto him making answer arose swift-footed
Achilles:<br />
<a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
197</span>&ldquo;Fearing nought, up and open the god&rsquo;s
will, all that is told thee:<br />
For by Apollo&rsquo;s self, heaven&rsquo;s favourite, whom thou,
Kalchas,<br />
Serving aright, to the armies aloud God-oracles op&rsquo;nest:<br
/>
None&mdash;while as yet I breathe upon earth, yet walk in the
daylight&mdash;<br />
Shall, at the hollow ships, lift hand of oppression against
thee,<br />
None out of all yon host&mdash;not and if thou said&rsquo;st
Agamemnon,<br />
Who now sits in his glory, the topmost flower of the
armies.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Then did the blameless prophet at last wax valiant
and answer:<br />
&ldquo;Lo!&nbsp; He doth not reprove us of prayer or of oxen
unoffered;<br />
<a name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 198</span>But for
his servant&rsquo;s sake, the disdained of king Agamemnon,<br />
(In that he loosed not his daughter, inclined not his ear to a
ransom,)&mdash;<br />
Therefore the Far-darter sendeth, and yet shall send on us,
evil.<br />
Nor shall he stay from the slaughter the hand that is heavy upon
you,<br />
Till to her own dear father the bright-eyed maiden is yielded,<br
/>
No price asked, no ransom; and ships bear hallow&egrave;d oxen<br
/>
Chryse-wards:&mdash;then, it may be, will he shew mercy and hear
us.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; These words said, sat he down.&nbsp; Then rose in
his place and addressed them<br />
Atreus&rsquo; warrior son, Agamemnon king of the nations,<br />
<a name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>Sore
grieved.&nbsp; Fury was working in each dark cell of his
bosom,<br />
And in his eye was a glare as a burning fiery furnace:<br />
First to the priest he addressed him, his whole mien boding a
mischief.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Priest of ill luck!&nbsp; Never heard I of
aught good from thee, but evil.<br />
Still doth the evil thing unto thee seem sweeter of
utt&rsquo;rance;<br />
Leaving the thing which is good all unspoke, all
unaccomplished.<br />
Lo! this day to the people thou say&rsquo;st, God-oracles
opening,<br />
What, but that <i>I</i> am the cause why the god&rsquo;s hand
worketh against them,<br />
For that in sooth I rejected a ransom, aye and a rich one,<br />
<a name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 200</span>Brought
for the girl Briseis.&nbsp; I did.&nbsp; For I chose to possess
her,<br />
Rather, at home: less favour hath Clytemnestra before me,<br />
Clytemnestra my wife: unto her Briseis is equal,<br />
Equal in form and in stature, in mind and in womanly wisdom.<br
/>
Still, even thus, am I ready to yield her, so it be better:<br />
Better is saving alive, I hold, than slaying a nation.<br />
Meanwhile deck me a guerdon in her stead, lest of Achaians<br />
I should alone lack honour; an unmeet thing and a shameful.<br />
See all men, that my guerdon, I wot not whither it
goeth.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Then unto him made answer the swift-foot chieftain
Achilles:<br />
<a name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>&ldquo;O
most vaunting of men, most gain-loving, off-spring of Atreus!<br
/>
How shall the lords of Achaia bestow fresh guerdon upon thee?<br
/>
Surely we know not yet of a treasure piled in abundance:<br />
That which the sacking of cities hath brought to us, all hath an
owner,<br />
Yea it were all unfit that the host make redistribution.<br />
Yield thou the maid to the god.&nbsp; So threefold surely and
fourfold<br />
All we Greeks will requite thee, should that day dawn, when the
great Gods<br />
Grant that of yon proud walls not one stone rest on
another.&rdquo;</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
